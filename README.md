Day 1: Incoming Broadcast from InventrCorp
  This was just a setup and introduction lesson. I learned how to write code to run on an arduino. The code turns on and off a light on the board.
  
Day 2: It's really dark in here...
  I learned about circuts and how to turn on and off an LED light on a bread boards with an arduino. 

Day3: I'm worried about your battery levels
  Today I added a switch to the circut, so the LED light can be turned on and off manually. 
  
Day 4: Cabin Lighting
  Today I used the switch more by adding more LED lights and I was able to turn on different LEDs with the switch that was placed on the bread board.
