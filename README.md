This repo holds code for the 30 Days Lost in Space challenge from invenr.io

Day 1: Incoming Broadcast from InventrCorp <br />
  This was just a setup and introduction lesson. I learned how to write code to run on an arduino. The code turns on and off a light on the board.<br />
  
Day 2: It's really dark in here...<br />
  I learned about circuts and how to turn on and off an LED light on a breadboards with an arduino.<br /> 

Day3: I'm worried about your battery levels<br />
  Today I added a switch to the circut, so the LED light can be turned on and off manually. <br />
  
Day 4: Cabin Lighting<br />
  Today I used the switch more by adding more LED lights and I was able to turn on different LEDs with the switch that was placed on the breadboard.<br />

Day 5: Creative Day<br />
  Today I created a simple traffic light with LED lights and the breadboard. It changes the stage of the lights every second.<br />

Day 6: Time to fix the battery<br />
  Today I learned how to use a monitor sensor and analog pins on the hero board.
  
Day 7: We still need to keep an eye on this<br />
  Today I learned how to take the data from the monitor sensor and use the data collected in my code and display it for the used to see. <br />
  
Day 8: Adding some color to this dark place<br />
  Today I learned how to used a RGB LED and I learned about PWM.
